In this apple promotional video from 1988, it shows how the Macintosh could be used to play MIDI. The presenter is using a set of electric MIDI drums to pass MIDI messages to the Macintosh, something that we take for granted today. We also tested playing MIDI through a computer using an adapter in the course, and showed that while its a niche use of a computer, the possibility has become available for everyone.

Wendy Carlos descirbes in this video the basics of the Synthesizer; Sine, Square, Triangle, Pulse, and Noise are explained with a simple envelope used later to shape the notes. While it has been mentioned in class before, it is fascinating how much simpler each of these elements are created, used, and saved today. With the physical knobs and plugs surrounding Wendy, its no surprise that a musician could forget which settings everything was on when a interesting note is created. It's no wonder then, that digital synthesizers became so popular once they had the ability to save presets.
