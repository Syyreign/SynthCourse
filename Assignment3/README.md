In this apple promotional video from 1988, it shows how the Macintosh could be used to play MIDI. The presenter is using a set of electric MIDI drums to pass MIDI messages to the Macintosh, something that we take for granted today. We also tested playing MIDI through a computer using an adapter in the course, and showed that while its a niche use of a computer, the possibility has become available for everyone.

Wendy Carlos descirbes in this video the basics of the Synthesizer; Sine, Square, Triangle, Pulse, and Noise are explained with a simple envelope used later to shape the notes. While it has been mentioned in class before, it is fascinating how much simpler each of these elements are created, used, and saved today. With the physical knobs and plugs surrounding Wendy, its no surprise that a musician could forget which settings everything was on when a interesting note is created. It's no wonder then, that digital synthesizers became so popular once they had the ability to save presets.

## **4 Additive Synthesis Coffee Mugs**
When playing both of the sounds back to back, you can kind of tell which coffee mug is which. However, since we are limited to only 4 oscillators, the sound is very artificial, and struggles to capture some of the complicated ringing of the mug.

## **5 Modal Synthesis Coffee Mugs**
The modal synthesis sounds noticably more natural than the additive. Its easier to pick out which coffee mug is which since they have slightly different frequencies when they ring, and this is picked up by the synthesis.

When comparing Additive vs Spectra, its noticable how the modal creates a more long lasting and bell like noise, while the additive is more artificial. This is hard to spot in the Spectra. However what is noticable in the spectra, is how the lower end notes almost disappears for the modal approximation. This isn't completely noticable in the audio at first, but the modal can be perceived to lack punch compared to the additive.
