Wendy Carlos descirbes in this video the basics of the Synthesizer; Sine, Square, Triangle, Pulse, and Noise are explained with a simple envelope used later to shape the notes. While it has been mentioned in class before, it is fascinating how much simpler each of these elements are created, used, and saved today. With the physical knobs and plugs surrounding Wendy, its no surprise that a musician could forget which settings everything was on when a interesting note is created. It's no wonder then, that digital synthesizers became so popular once they had the ability to save presets.
