As the paper describes, water on its own does not create a large noise. The sound we hear from water droplets and bubbles come from the trapping of air under the waters surface. When this pocket of air collapses, it produces a sinosoidal sound. Its explained that volume pulsation is the main idea behind a bubble noise, with the bubble being a compressible region within the water which is itself incompressible. We can model this interaction using a spring mass system.
